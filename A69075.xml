            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>That the warre of mankinde with the Diuell is a lawfull warre proclaimed of God, which is alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and without al truce: and therefore that here it is wherein we muſt ſhew our choler, our hate, our valour, our ſtrength; not faintly and in ſhew only,

               <p>A puniſhment, which although it be more heauie vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> yet it is alſo common to the woman: namely, the curſe of the earth for his ſake, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence came barrennes by thiſtles and thornes, &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of firſt the effect ſhould be ſorrow and grief of mind. Secondly, labour to the ſweat of his browes, to draw neceſſarie food from it, and that as long as hee liued.

               </p>
               <p>That all men, from him that ſitteth in the throne, to him that draweth water, are bound to painfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, either of the body or of the minde, what wealth or patrimonie ſoeuer is left them, although hee had wherewith otherwiſe plentifully to liue.</p>

                  <hi>But it was ſaid that at what time ſoeuer they ate of it, they ſhould certainly die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo they were dead in ſin, which is more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then the death of the bodie, as that which is a ſeparation from God: whereby they were alreadie entred vpon death and hell, to which they ſhould haue proceeded, vntill it had bin accompliſhed both in bodie and ſoule in hell with the Diuell and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for euer, if the Lord had not looked vpon them in the bleſſed ſeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How doth it agree with the goodnes, or with the very iuſtice of God, to puniſh one ſo fearfully for eating of a little fruit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very well: for the ſin was horrible, firſt, by doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the truth of God. Secondly, a crediting of the word of Gods enemie and theirs. Thirdly, a charge againſt God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he enuied their good eſtate. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, intollerable pride and ambition, in deſiring to be equall in knowledge to God himſelfe. Laſt of all, (which much aggrauateth the ſin) for that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement he brake was ſo eaſie to be kept, as to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from one only fruite in ſo great plentie and varietie.</p>

               <p>Secondly, they are perfectly profitable to inſtruct to ſaluation in themſelues, and all other imperfectly

               <p>Fourthly, that the primitiue churches after the Apoſtles, both Greeke and Latin, did only receaue

               <p>
                  <hi>What noble effects doth the Apoſtle ſet forth of the bookes of the Scripture?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>How is that proued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, for that God is the author of them, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his wiſedome able, and for his loue to his Church willing to ſet downe ſuch a rule as may guide them to eternall life, hath not failed herein. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that it is profitable to teach all true doctrine, and to confute the falſe, to correct al diſorder, priuate and publique, and to informe men in the way of righteouſnes.

               </p>
               <p>Moſt ſtrongly: for there being required more of a Miniſter that muſt be the eye and mouth of the people themſelues, if it make him perfect, it is much more able to giue them ſufficient inſtruction.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat is the drift of this place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſheweth two wayes wherein happines is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, the works of the law, and faith in the promiſe of grace: that the Law is not that way, whereby we can receiue the happines we haue loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is that ſhewed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that the promiſe of grace, whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified, was 430. yeares before the Law; and therefore that the Law which commeth after cannot make void the couenant of grace; which it ſhould doe, if a man were iuſtified by the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it may be ſaid, that the iuſtification by workes of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19187:42"/> the Law, doth not make voide the promiſe of grace, when as the matter is ſo handled, as ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commeth in part by the works of the Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes verely it is made voide: for if ſaluation were before the Law was, only by grace, and now ſhould be by works and grace, then the promiſe of grace only, ſhould be made void. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the 18. verſe doth ſhew that if it be of the Law, it cannot be by the promiſe of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then it ſhould ſeeme there is no vſe of the Law, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it doth not iuſtifie vs in all, nor in part?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not ſo: for it was giuen to ſhew and diſcouer ſin, yea through the corruption of our nature to increaſe ſin, ſo farre is it from taking away ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is that ſhewed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the manner of the giuing, which was with ſuch terror of thunder, lightnings, and ſmoke, and fearefull ſound of the trumpet, as the people could not abide the voyce of God: but were faine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that they might not heare the voyce of God, but that <hi>Moſes</hi> might bee a Mediatour to receiue it at Gods hands, and they at his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat obſerue you from that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Law is terrible vnto vs by reaſon of our ſinnes, and driueth vs to ſeeke for a mediatour which is Chriſt alone, figured in the mediation of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>If the promiſe of grace take away ſinne, and the Law increaſe ſinne; if it take away the conſcience of ſinne, and this doth cauſe a conſcience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of ſinne; it ſeemeth that the Law is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the promiſe of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not a whit: for the Law would alſo take away ſin and the conſcience of ſinne, if any man were able
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19187:42"/> perfectly to performe it: ſo that the Law cauſeth no ſinne of it ſelfe, but by reaſon of our corruption, and is a furtherance to the ſaluation that is by grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tell vs then how the Law ſerueth, to the helping forward to the iuſtification, which is by the free grace of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law ſhutteth all men, and all that is of man, vnder ſinne: not to this end that they ſhould periſh, but contrariwiſe that they might be ſaued that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make that more plaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle compareth the Law to a Iuſtice of Peace, or a Sergeant which arreſteth ſuch as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe againſt it, and laieth them in priſon: not that they ſhould periſh with hunger, cold, or ſtinch of the priſon: but that when they feele their miſerie, and that of themſelues, and their workes, they cannot get out of it, they ſhould flie to the free pardon and grace of the Prince. And therefore not to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the promiſe of grace, but to helpe towards the obtaining of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is this further cleered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle compareth the Law to a garriſon, which is ſet in a towne to keepe men in ſeruitude, which haue not ſubiectly mindes to their Prince, to the end that comming to a iuſt and dutifull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they may be freed from the terror and ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the garriſon.</p>

               <p>It is a doctrine commanding the perfection of godlineſſe and righteouſneſſe: and being handled in euery booke of the Scripture, it is ſummarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued, firſt into ten words, or ten commandements: and then into two, which comprehend the whole ſumme of the Law, which are now to be ſpoken of.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Law chargeth the vnderſtanding to know euery dutie, euen all the will of God.

               <p>That the Law is perfect not onely charging the ſoule, but alſo the whole ſoule: not only to know, diſcerne, retaine, will, and follow good, but to doe the ſame perfectly. So in condemning euill, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth all euill, and in commanding good, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the fourth rule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Law forbiddeth or commandeth any thing, it forbiddeth and commandeth all meanes thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the fifth rule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer the Law commands, it forbids the contrarie, and whatſoeuer it forbids, it commandeth the contrarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why is euery commandement ſet foorth vnto vs, by the ſecond perſon of the ſingular number, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by you, or no man, or euery man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That euery particular man may know, that God ſpeaketh vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What gather you of that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That God wiſely preuenteth that commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeech: that which is ſpoken to all men is ſpoken vnto none. As it is the manner of men who can confeſſe that God is mercifull and righteous, and yet doe ſhift the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19187:44"/> matter to the generall, as if it did nothing belong vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the generall rules that belong to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. Of how many ſorts are the duties of the Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of two: of our duties to God, and of thoſe to our neighbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are thoſe towards God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of his worſhip, and therefore to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other towards our neighbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How may that further be ſhewed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the puniſhments: for the breaches of the firſt table are more ſeuerely puniſhed, then the breaches of the ſecond. As he that reuileth the Magiſtrate ſhal beare his ſinne: but he that blaſphemeth God, ſhall be ſtoned to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What gather you of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The craftie practiſes of the Papiſts, who make men beleeue, that chiefe godlineſſe doth conſiſt in the workes of the ſecond table; as in charitie, almes, &amp;c. thereby deceiuing the people to enrich themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are all the duties of the firſt table greater, then all the duties of the ſecond?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, if the compariſon be equall: as the chiefe of the firſt table with the chiefe of the ſecond; the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle duties of the one with the middle duties of the other; and the laſt and leaſt of the former, with the laſt and leaſt of the latter; otherwiſe not. For if the murther of a man be compared with the leaſt abuſe of the name of God; or adulterie with the leaſt breach of the Sabbath; theſe of the ſecond table are greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is this worſhip of God diuided?</hi>

               <p>Into that which is ſhut vp in the minde only, and that alſo which is declared by outward actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What conſider you in theſe words,</hi> I am the Lord thy God that brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage, Thou ſhalt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the preface to all the ten Commandements, and then the firſt commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is the preface ſet, as a reaſon to the obſeruation of all the Commandements?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus: If I be the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, thou muſt then keep al my commandements; but I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt keepe all my commandements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How can this belong vnto vs which are not Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wee are the Iſrael of God, and it ſerueth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a note vnto vs, to diſtinguiſh the true God from Idols of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhy doth the Lord make choice of that benefit, which nothing belongs vnto vs, rather then of any other, wherein we communicate with them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is the manner of God, to allure the Iſraelites as children, with temporall benefits, hauing reſpect to their infirmitie and childhood: whereas we are bleſſed of God with greater knowledge, and therefore are men in reſpect of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it was fitteſt to expreſſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall deliuerie from Satan by Chriſt, which was thereby repreſented: and ſo it belongeth no leſſe, yea more to vs then to them. And being freed from the ſlauerie of our enemies, whereunto wee were ſo neere more then once, and which wee iuſtly had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19187:45"/> euen that is matter of a great bond vnto our God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe it was the lateſt benefit, the ſweetnes wherof was yet (as it were) in their mouth. And herein the Lord reſpected our corrupt nature, that are readie to forget old benefits how great ſo euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the preface. What is the commandement?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt haue no other gods before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be conſidered in this commandement?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inward worſhip of God: as appeareth by the words <hi>before me,</hi> that whereof I alone take notice. Where we muſt take heed we imagine no likenes of God, thereby ſetting vp an idoll in our hearts, if wee liken him to any thing whatſoeuer. For the better auoidance whereof, we muſt ſettle our mindes vpon Chriſt, in whom only God is comprehenſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How many things are to be conſidered in the inward worſhip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two: according to the inward man; the former of the vnderſtanding, the other of the will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is required touching the vnderſtanding?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Knowledge, firſt, of the properties and actions of God, as is before ſaid; his Subſtance being paſt fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of man, or Angels. Secondly, faith both in beleeuing the things that are written of him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to our ſelues that God is good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is contrarie to this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To put our truſt in our ſelues, or in our friends, honour, wiſedome, money, learning or credit: which are but meanes giuen vs of God to glorifie him the better.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:19187:46"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is our dutie concerning this and all other good meanes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To truſt in God no leſſe when wee haue them, then when we want them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat vertue ariſeth of this trust and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hope, whereby we patiently attend for all things that we neede at Gods hands: not only when wee haue the meanes, but alſo when wee ſee no apparant meanes: as the Iſraelites did in the deſert, and when the meanes ſeeme contrarie, as the three compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelfe, and <hi>Iob, I will truſt in God although he kill me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat further ariſeth of theſe former vertues?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Humilitie, whereby we caſt our ſelues down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, to acknowledge our inſufficiencie in our ſelues: and ſo all our behauiour ſhould be ſeaſoned with humilitie.

               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat ſay you of the will and affections?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the will and affections is required, firſt, loue, that becauſe wee know and beleeue that he is good, we loue him aboue all: which loue (for that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loue God in himſelf) is then in truth in vs, when we loue his word and commandements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat is contrary to this loue of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The loue of our ſelues and of worldly pleaſures, for whoſe cauſe wee leaue thoſe duties which God craueth of vs: whereas loue requireth, that with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> wee ſhould wiſh our ſelues to be damned and accurſed, rather then the glorie of God ſhould any whit be ſtained.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>What is yet further required in the inward worſhip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reuerence of the Maieſty of God, in regard whereof we ſhould carrie ſuch ſhamefaſtnes in all our actions, that no vnſeemely behauiour may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from vs; which if men ſtriue to do before Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, much more ought we to ſtriue to doe the ſame before God.</p>

                  <hi>What is contrary to this reuerence of the Maieſty of God?</hi>

               <p>That hee will puniſh the offender both in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and children to many generations; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereof he ſhewes by comparing his wrath to the rage of a ielous husband, vpon the vnchaſt beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of his wife.</p>

               <p>That is not enough: for to the end we ſhould not plunge our ſelues ſo deeply into the affaires of the world, from whence wee ſhould not recouer our ſelues; the wiſedome of God hath thought good, that one day in ſeuen there ſhould be an intermiſſion from them, when wee ſhould wholly ſeparate our ſelues to the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What other can you alleage?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that a whole day is needfull for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the whole ſeruice of God, hearing of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayer and the word preached, catechiſing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, exerciſe of holie diſcipline, and conſideration of the glorie of God in the creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What further?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that if <hi>Adam</hi> in his perfection had need of this helpe, much more we, which are ſo grieuouſly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You are then of iudgement, that the reſt of the Lords day and of the ſeuenth day cannot be taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea verely, as that which is conſtantly and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How proue you that this commandement is not cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall but perpetuall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, no Ceremonie hath place in the morall Law whereof this is a part: otherwiſe if this be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, then there are but nine words. Secondly, for that it was written by the finger of God, which the Ceremonies were not. Thirdly, it was written in tables of ſtone, as to ſignifie the hardneſſe of our hearts, ſo to ſignifie the continuance of it. Fourthly, it was before any ſhadow or ceremonie, yea before
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19187:53"/> Chriſt was promiſed, whom al ceremonies haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſith it ſometime ſhadowed our eternall reſt: is it not therefore ceremoniall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That followeth not: for that the ceremonie of repreſentation of the ſpirituall reſt, came after the commandement of the reſt; and therefore is acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorie and accidentall; for which cauſe the time of correction and of aboliſhment of ceremonies being come, that ceremonie may well fall away, and yet the Commandement remaine, as being not of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haue you yet any further reaſon to confirme the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of the reſt of the ſeuenth day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt willing his children which ſhould liue about 40. yeeres after his aſcenſion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</note> to pray that their flight might not bee vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, thereby to hinder them in the ſeruice of God; doth thereby ſufficiently declare that hee held not this Commandement in the account of a ceremony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But is our rest vpon the Lords day or Sunday perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and vnchangeable? or may not another ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day be placed in ſtead thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No creature in heauen or earth can alter it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why ſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe as God ceaſed from his labors on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday: ſo Chriſt ceaſed from afflictions on the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. As the one therefore was ſanctified in regard of the creation; much more ſhould the other bee ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in reſpect of the reſtoring and redemption of the world, being a greater worke then the creation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe this Commandement hath leaſt light of nature to direct vs to the obſeruation of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for that wee are naturally moſt negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the obſeruation of this, in ſuffering our ſelues to be with drawne by our worldly buſineſſe, from

                  <hi>What is it wee ſhould here remember, for the better ſanctifying of the Sabbath?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we ſhould compaſſe all our buſineſſe within the working daies, that the worldly affaires enter not or encroch into poſſeſſion of the Lords day; not onely willingly, but not ſo much as by any forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: as when for want of foreſight the payment of money due by obligation falleth out on that day.</p>

                  <hi>What gather you from thence?</hi>

               <p>The inequall and niggardlie dealing of men with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ſo?</hi>

               <p>For that by this commandement, asking at their ſeruants hands the worke of a whole day, yet in the Lords day are contented, both for themſelues and thoſe vnder them, to meaſure the day at three or foure houres; vſing one meaſure to mete the ſeruice due vnto them, and another to mete the ſeruice due vnto God; which thing is abominable before God,<note place="margin">

               <p>A reaſon expreſſed, which depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vpon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God: That as God hauing made all things in the ſixe daies, reſted the ſeuenth from creating any more; ſo ſhould we reſt from all our owne works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was the Lord idle on the ſeuenth day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No verilie: he did a great work in preſeruing the things created.

                  <hi>What is meant by ſanctifying?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Setting apart from worldly buſines to the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What by bleſsing?</hi>

                  <hi>May not that which ſeemes our dutie to man hinder the honour of God?</hi>

               <p>Sometime it may ſo fall out, that that which men require, and that (commonly) of right, may not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: as <hi>Rahab,</hi> being ſubiect to the King of Iericho, ſhould haue failed in her dutie, if ſhe had ſent the ſpies at the Kings commandement, (ſhee preferring the obedience ſhe owed to God, before the dutie ſhe owed to man.)

                  <hi>Why are all ſuperiours called by the name of parents?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The anſwere is, that our Sauiour meaneth onely to reſtraine the ambitious titles of the Phariſies in thoſe daies, which deſired not onely ſo to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but that men ſhould reſt in their authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>

                  <hi>What ſay you of his Godhead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he is the onely naturall ſonne of the moſt high and eternall God his father, his word, character, and image, God coeſſentiall and coequall with the father and the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doe you then hold that he is, and is called the ſon of God in regard of his Godhead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes verily, and not according to his manhood; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, who ſaith, that hee is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out father according to his manhood,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>It ſeemeth he is called the ſonne of God in reſpect of his humane nature; in the generation whereof it is ſaid that the holy Ghoſt did that which fathers doe in the naturall generation, eſpecially ſeeing he is therefore ſaid the ſonne of the higheſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, but onely in regard of the eternall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, otherwiſe there ſhould bee two ſonnes; one of the father, and another of the holy Ghoſt: but he is therefore called the ſonne of the moſt higheſt, for that none could be ſo conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, but he that is the naturall ſon of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is he ſaid to be conceiued by the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe the holy Ghoſt by his incomprehenſible power, wrought his conception ſupernaturally,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19187:79"/> which fathers doe naturally in the begetting of their children; not that any of the ſubſtance of the holy Ghoſt, which is indiuiſible, came into the wombe of the Virgin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why is he ſaid to be in the beginning?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not becauſe he began then to bee: but that then he was; and therefore is from eternities.</p>

                  <hi>VVhy did hee not take the nature of Angels vpon him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe hee had no meaning to ſaue the Angels that fell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.</note> for that they had committed the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, in falling malitiouſly into rebellion againſt God, without tentation.</p>

                  <hi>Are not the elect Angels any way benefited by the humanity of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Properly his humanity reacheth onely to ſinfull mankind: for if he had ment to haue benefited An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (otherwiſe then confirming them) by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother nature, he would haue taken their nature vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
               <p>

               <p>It is vnderſtood of the Saints then in heauen, and not any way of the Angels; although in Chriſt the Angels bee elected, and by him confirmed, ſo that they ſhall ſtand for euermore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Did hee not paſſe through the Virgin Mary (as ſome affirme) as ſaffron out of a bagge, or water through a conduit?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By aſſuming and taking of the manhood to the Godhead; for otherwiſe there ſhould be two ſonnes, one of the holy Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> and another of God: then conſequently alſo two perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Godhead be not changed into the manhood; is it not at leaſt mingled with the manhood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing leſſe: for then he ſhould be neither God nor man, for things mingled together cannot retaine the name of one of the ſimples: As honie and oyle being mingled together cannot bee called honie or oyle. Secondly, the properties of the Godhead can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree to the properties of the manhood; nor the properties of the manhood to the Godhead: for as the Godhead cannot thirſt; no more can the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19187:80"/> bee in all or many places at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But was not this performed after his reſurrection, that the glorie of the Godhead then more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully communicated with the manhood, ſwallowed vp the truth thereof, as a whole ſea one drop of oyle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, for theſe two natures continued ſtill diſtinct in ſubſtance, properties and actions, and ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one and the ſame Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>VVhy tooke he our nature vpon him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe the iuſtice of God could no otherwiſe be ſatisfied, then by our nature which had committed the ſin: and for that he could not ſuffer in his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is there no vſe of the Godhead of Chriſt in his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes: it was neceſſarie hee ſhould bee God that ſhould ſuffer, that he might be able to ouercome the infinite ſufferings due to vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hitherto of the natures of our Sauiour, diuine and humane. What is to be conſidered in the coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of theſe two natures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That theſe two natures vnſeparablie ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the firſt moment the holy Virgin concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, made but one perſon: a myſterie that no Angel, much leſſe man is able to comprehend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhy ſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that the manhood of our Sauiour Chriſt is perſonally vnited to the Godhead, whereas the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of much greater glory then men, are not able to abide the preſence of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat is the vſe of this coniunction of two natures into one perſon?</hi>

               <p>That it is a foule errour in them, that thinke that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19187:82"/> our Sauiour Chriſt deliuered not all things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the neceſſary inſtruction and gouernment of the Church, but left them to the traditions and other meere inuentions of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What further?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Miniſters of the word ſhould not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in ſilence the things that are neceſſarily to bee deliuered.

                  <hi>Did his office of Doctorſhip, then firſt begin when he came into the world?</hi>

               <p>No: but when he opened firſt his fathers will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, by the miniſtery of his ſeruants the Prophets: which the holy Ghoſt calleth <hi>the doctrine of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſt;</hi>

               <p>Secondly, that by vertue of his propheticall office, hee did not onely bring an outward ſound vnto the eare; but wrought (as hee did before his comming, and as he doth now by the Miniſtery of his word,) an alteration in the mind, ſo far as to the clearing of the vnderſtanding.</p>

               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:19187:83"/>

                  <hi>Wherein ſtandeth the manner of him that ſhall haue this office?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Partly without him, and partly in himſelfe. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, as that hee was of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> this of the tribe of <hi>Leui.</hi> Secondly, that the Prieſts of <hi>Leui</hi> were appointed by the Law of the fleſhly Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; where Chriſt was appointed by the Law of the power of life. Thirdly, in that he was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his father by an oath, for euer to bee a prieſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>What benefit ariſeth to vs in that this was confirmed with an oth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It aſſureth vs of all the parts of his Prieſthood to be performed vnto vs, and that he paid the ranſome for our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was not the word of God ſufficient for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this promiſe, without the binding of it with an oth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes doubtleſſe: but the Lord in this promiſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to deale with man, and willing more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew vnto the heires of promiſe the ſtableneſſe of his counſell; bound himſelfe by an oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereby is the perpetuitie thereof confirmed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that it did not proceed by ſucceſſion, as from <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>Eleazer,</hi> from <hi>Eleazer</hi> to <hi>Phinees,</hi> and ſo by deſcent, but is euerlaſting, alwaies abiding in him; which is another difference of their prieſtly Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What profit commeth to vs by the perpetuitie of his Prieſthood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he continually maketh interceſſion for vs to God, and of himſelfe alone is able to ſaue vs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the father through him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the qualitie of him that is to be Prieſt,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19187:84"/> which is without him. What is that part which is within him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that in himſelfe he is holy. Secondly, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers harmeleſſe and innocent. Thirdly, vndefiled of others, or of any thing; and to ſpeake in a word, he is ſeparated from ſinners. In al which, he differeth from that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> for they are neither holy in themſelues, nor innocent, neither vndefiled, but polluting, and being polluted by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the fruit we gather of this his holineſſe, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and vndefiledneſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he being holy and innocent, vndefiled, and ſo conſequently ſeparate from ſinners; the ſinne is not attributed to the faithful; and theſe his properties are imputed for theirs: And therefore he freeth them both from original and actual ſinne. Contrary to the doctrine of the Papiſts, who ſay, <hi>that he deliuereth vs from originall ſinne only, and that we must make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for actuall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is touching the execution of this his office?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in that they offered firſt for themſelues; hee for the people onely, for himſelfe he heeded not. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he but once; they many times. Thirdly, hee offered himſelfe, they ſomething elſe then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the vſe of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prooue the abſoluteneſſe, perfection, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of this his prieſt-hood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May not the Prieſthood of the Papiſts be ouerthrown, and prooued to be a falſe Prieſthood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes verily, by all theſe arguments: as firſt, they are not of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> neither confirmed by an oth, and therefore not perpetuall. Secondly, they are
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19187:84"/> not holy in themſelues, but vnholy; neither innocent, not vndefiled, but defiling others, and being defiled of them, and ſo not ſeparate from ſinners, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinfull and ſet in ſinne. Thirdly, they offer firſt for themſelues, then for the people likewiſe many times, and ſacrifices which are not themſelues and laſtly, they bring a great diſgrace to the Prieſthood of Chriſt, by preferring themſelues to him, as the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to the ſacrifice whom they ſay they offer.</p>

               <p>Secondly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as there is in vs no aduice of our ſelues, ſo there is in vs no ſound ſtrength to keepe vs from any euill; but that as he giueth good aduice to his, ſo doth he with his owne power performe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.

               <p>Thirdly, that wee ſhould take heed how wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his obedience: for he will doe what hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth. For if to obey be a good meanes to helpe vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fauour of our earthly Princes; it will much

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19187:100"/> the Popiſh fained Sacrament of confirmation is notablie iniurious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What things are to be conſidered in this Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the time, and then the things that are to bee done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The time of the adminiſtration of this Sacrament ſeemeth not to agree with that which hath beene generally taught of the Sacraments: for this was by our Sauiour Chriſt not miniſtred on the Lords day, and it was alſo ministred at night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although our Sauiour Chriſt did ſo, yet hee did not bid vs ſo to doe; but the Apoſtles example and religious practiſe herein is to be followed, which did celebrate the ſupper of the Lord vpon the Lords day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But yet it ſeemeth that both the example of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles doth tie vs to the time of the night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing leſſe: for our Sauiour did miniſter it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupper, for that it was to come in liew and ſtead of the Paſſeouer; and therefore was preſently after the eating of it. Secondly, that it might goe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before his paſſion, the better to ſhew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it ſhould haue relation. Where alſo is another difference: our Sauiour Chriſts ſupper repreſenting his death, which followed the ſupper and was to come: our Sacrament repreſenting the death of Chriſt already ſuffered and paſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What cauſe had the Apoſtles to minister it after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which we haue not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles did it in the night, becauſe it was not ſafe for the Church to meet in the day for feare of perſecution: wherefore herein the laudable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19187:100"/> of the Church of adminiſtring it in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when our wits and capacities are beſt, is to bee followed. In which reſpect alſo there is ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene this Sacrament, and the Sacrament of Baptiſme; which may without any inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be adminiſtred in the after noone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is there nothing to bee learned in that our Sauiour Christ and his Apostles administred it after ſupper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes verily: for thereby wee learne, that wee muſt not come for our bellies, but haue our minds lifted vp from theſe earthly elements to our Sauiour Chriſt, repreſented by them: for men after ſupper ſet not bread and wine, but banquetting diſhes vpon the table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What vſe is there of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, to reproue ſuch profane perſons, as come for a draught of wine alone. Secondly, thoſe that reſt onely on the outward elements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the time, now to the things to be done in the Lords Supper: and how ſhall wee conſider them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, what is generally to be done of all, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and Communicants. Secondly, what is to be done of the Miniſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is generally to be done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There muſt be a careful preparation before the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, great heed in the action, and a ioyful &amp; thankfull cloſe and ſhutting vp of it. In the two former where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is great difference betweene our Sauiour Chriſt and all other Miniſters: who hauing no bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of the ſpirit with the fleſh in him, but being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies prepared vnto euery good worke, had no need
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19187:101"/> of them, the Miniſters hauing as much neede as the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How are we to prepare our ſelues to this Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are before wee come vnto it to examine our wiſedome and knowledge in this Sacrament, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee can giue a reaſon of the repreſentation of Chriſt in the bread and wine; and bring the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and difference of the proportion of the bread and wine, with the body and blood of Chriſt; and of the eating and drinking of the elements, with the partaking of the ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What further examination is to bee vſed before wee come?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that come to this holy Sacrament muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelues of their faith, and repentance for their particular ſins: to bewaile them, and to iudge themſelues for them; leſt in comming otherwiſe they procure the wrath of God againſt them, and thoſe that belong vnto them; although not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in the world to come, (which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full notwithſtanding their vnworthie receiuing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come vnto) yet to fearefull plagues and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this world. Whereby all not of age and ſound iudgement, are ſhut from this Sacrament, which are not alwaies from the other of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How are we to behaue our ſelues in the action?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſeeing of the bread and wine, wee are to call to mind the body and blood of our Sauiour Chriſt; at the bread broken before our eyes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his paſſion and ſufferings; and ſo in the wine being powred out, to repreſent vnto vs his blood trickling and ſtreaming downe from all parts of him to the ground.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:19187:101"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is further to be done in the action?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in that the Miniſter giueth the bread &amp; wine, to think, that God giueth Chriſt, and Chriſt himſelfe to vs: and as wee put our hand to take the bread and wine; ſo by faith to applie Chriſt to our ſelues: and by the eating and drinking of the bread and wine, to remember our vniting to Chriſt, and enioying of him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, according as it is commanded, all muſt take the bread and wine into their hands: contrary to the ſuperſtition of diuers, which will either haue it thruſt into their mouthes, or elſe take it with their gloues: as if the hand of a Chriſtian, which God hath both made and ſanctified, were not as fit as the skin of a beaſt, which the Artificer hath tanned and ſewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What further did they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ate and dranke the bread and wine, not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or hanging it vp, or worſhipping it, as doe the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſeemeth they haue the words of Christ to lead them to the worſhip of them; ſeeing he ſaith of the bread, that it is his body, and of the wine, that it is his blood; and there is nothing impoſsible vnto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words of eating and drinking, doe properly belong to the outward elements of bread and wine, and by a borrowed ſpeech do vnproperly belong to the body and blood of Chriſt; conſidering, that as the Sacrament of Baptiſme doth ſeale vnto vs a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall regeneration: ſo the Lords ſupper, a ſpirituall feeding. And euen as well the body and blood of Chriſt is in baptiſme giuen vs for clothing, as they are giuen in the Lords ſupper for nouriſhment. And as for that which is alledged of the poſſibilitie of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19187:102"/> God to do all things; we anſwer, that the queſtion is here, not of the power, but of the will of God, what he will haue done. Beſides, that God cannot do thoſe things, in doing whereof he ſhould contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.</note> And therefore the Scripture feareth not (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſhonour to God) to ſay, that he cannot lie, nor cannot denie himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is noted by this borrowed ſpeech?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The communion wee haue with our Sauiour Chriſt; of whom we are as verily partakers by a liuely faith, as of the bread and wine, by eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What reaſon was there to mooue our Sauiour Christ to vſe this borrowed ſpeech, in this ſo great a mysterie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not onely the vſe and cuſtome of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before mentioned, but for that the ſelfe ſame manner of ſpeech is vſed in the new Teſtament, of Baptiſme, called the new birth, and waſhing of ſins, whereof it is onely a ſeale: So that vnleſſe the Lord would haue departed from that wiſdome of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God accuſtomablie receiued; he muſt needs here alſo tread in the ſame ſteps of borrowed figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howbeit, it may ſeeme that to haue vſed a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech, would haue bin more meet for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere vnto his death, and more conuenient for their vnderstanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He did after his laſt Supper vſe as figuratiue ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as this, in the 14. and 16. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the danger of darkenes of ſpeech (there being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes more light in a borrowed, then in a proper ſpeech.) And they muſt needs yeeld a trope, when
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19187:102"/> he ſaith, that the cup is the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It maketh further for the reall preſence, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ ſaith in his Supper, that his body was then broken, and not that it ſhould bee broken after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is alſo vſuall to the Scripture, for further cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, to ſpeake of things to come, as of them that are preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seeing we are entred vpon this matter, what reaſon can you gather from this institution, to ouerthrow the carnall preſence of Christ in the Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the bread were Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then there ſhould be two Chriſts, one that giueth, another that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; for our Sauiour Chriſt gaue the bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if the bread bee the very body of Chriſt, then there is no ſigne of the thing ſignified, and therefore no Sacrament. Where their miſerable ſhift, that the whiteneſſe is the ſeale and ſigne, is not worthie the anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be done after the action?</hi>

               <p>To bee comforted in heart in the fauour of God towards vs; from whence we ſhould be readie with a feeling ioy to ſing a Pſalme vnto the Lord and to feele a further deading of the old man, and ſtrength of the new man; to walke more ſtrongly and ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the waies of God, all the daies of our life. For it is a Sacrament not of our in corporation as Baptiſme, but of our growth; which albeit one cannot alwaies diſcerne immediately after the action yet betweene that and the next communion, it may be eaſily eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in our ſeruice towards God and men.</p>

               <p>Firſt, hee declared the doctrine of the myſtery of the Sacrament vnto his Apoſtles, which receiued it: by teaching the truth of that which theſe outward things did ſignifie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he thanked his heauenly Father for that he had ſo loued the world, that he gaue him, which

Secondly, the like manner of ſpeech in other places of Scripture, where there being no mention what words he vſed; yet muſt needs bee granted that he gaue thanks, and praied, proportionably to the prayer and thanks here vſed. For taking the barlely loaues and fiſhes, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thanks; what can be vnderſtood, but that he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thanks to God, that had giuen thoſe creatures for the bodily nouriſhment, prayed that hee would bleſſe them, and make them effectuall to that end? And as it is not lawfull, to eate and drinke the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meat and drink without ſuch praier and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing; ſo is it not lawfull to communicate theſe Elements without thankſgiuing and prayer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thus much of the preface: Now wee are to come to the prayer it ſelfe. What is generall vnto it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That our affections, with zeale and earneſtneſſe, ought to wait and attend on praier: which appeareth by the ſhortneſſe of all the petitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is declared hereby?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great affection we ſhould haue to the things we come for: which giueth a check to our cold pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, where the vnderſtanding is without the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and, as it were, the ſacrifice without the heauenly fire to lift it vp and make it mount into heauen, both in publike and priuat prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of attention generall to the prayer. What are the parts thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:19187:111"/>
               <p>A forme of petition and of thankſgiuing.</p>

               <p>Secondly, that it is a fault of vs, when wee are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, in publike prayer to come in petition, but not returne thankſgiuing for our benefits receiued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the parts of prayer. How many ſorts of petitions are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two: one ſort of petitions is of thoſe things that belong to Gods glory: the other ſort of petitions doth concerne our ſelues and our neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is generall to bee conſidered in thoſe petitions that concerne God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That wee are to ſeeke the ſeruice of God before our owne things; as alſo the Commandements teach vs, which being diuided into two tables, the firſt concerneth the worſhip of God; the ſecond table, our ſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What obſerue you from this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our hypocriſie: for were it not for our ſelues and wants, we would not come at all in prayer: as in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie all their prayers are for themſelues, and their ſaluation, &amp;c. Whereas this word <hi>Thy,</hi> in al theſe peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doth ſhut forth the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our ſelues, to the end that we might haue our minds altogether faſtened vpon the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat further obſerue you proper to theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they ought to bee performed with further zeale and earneſtneſſe of ſpirit; as may bee gathered
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:19187:112"/> in that they are propounded without any bond of one with another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How are the petitions that concerne Gods glory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Into two: the firſt concerneth Gods glory it ſelfe, the other two the things whereby God is glorified; as when his kingdome commeth, and his will is done.</p>

                  <hi>VVhat is meant by (hallowed?)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To hallow is to ſet apart a thing from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe to ſome proper end; and therefore to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and hallow the name of God, is to ſet it apart from all abuſes to a holy and reuerent vſe.</p>

               <p>No, wee cannot adde any holineſſe vnto God, or take away from him: but that as God is holy in his properties and actions, and alſo in his ordinances both in Church and Common-wealth; ſo we deſire it may be, and that not onely in our ſelues, but alſo in all men, that they may be acknowledged and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as they are worthie in themſelues to bee reputed and accounted.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That it is a ſingular benefit of God to be admitted to the ſanctifying of his name, and as it were to ſet the crowne vpon his heade, and to hold it there; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing he is able himſelfe alone to do it: and when he would vſe other thereunto, hee hath ſo many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Angels to do it; yea, that can raiſe vp ſtones to doe it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That as in the former, the word <hi>(thy)</hi> did only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect God; ſo in theſe following, by theſe words (<hi>Ours</hi> and <hi>vs</hi>) we learne to haue a fellow feeling of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and neceſſities of others; and therfore in care to pray for them; which is the triall of the true ſpirit of prayer.</p>

               <p>That for them all, we depend on God: on his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, for the firſt of our nouriſhing; on his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for pardon of our ſinnes; and on his power, for ſtrength to reſiſt tentation.</p>

               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is the maner of the Scriptures, commonly to put things firſt that are ſooneſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched. Secondly, that by experience of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt things, as a ſtep or degree, wee may climbe vp to higher. Whereby their hypocriſie is diſcouered, which pretend great aſſurance of forgiuenes of ſins, and of their keeping from the euill one, whereas they are diſtruſtfull of the things of this life. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in hauing aforehand earthly things, we may bee the readier and more earneſt to intreate for the ſpirituall: ſo our Sauiour Chriſt healed the bodily diſeaſes, to prouoke all men to come to him for the cure of the ſpirituall.</p>

               <p>Firſt, all outward things, both for our neceſſity, and chriſtian delight, as well in clothing as in feeding. Secondly, all the meanes and helpes to attaine them, as good Princes, Magiſtrates, ſeaſonable weather, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>The frailety of our nature, not able to continue in health ſcarce one day without theſe helpes, and as it were proppes to vphold this decayed and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous cottage of our mortall bodies; leſſe able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare them then many beaſts: for ſeeing there was a

               <p>It is a righteous thing with God to puniſh ſinne with ſinne; and ſo to caſt a ſinner into further ſinnes by way of iuſt puniſhment: therfore we deſire God not to giue vs ouer to our ſelues by withdrawing his ſpirit from vs: as when men doe delight in lies,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24.</note> hee giueth them ouer to beleeue lies; and for Idolatrie, they bee iuſtly puniſhed with corporall filthineſſe in the ſame degree.

                  <hi>How elſe are Gods actions diſcerned from the actions of the wicked?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the end whither they tend: for <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren ſent him, to the end he ſhould not come to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he foretold out of his dreame: but God ſent him to prouide for his Church, and to fulfill that was foretold. <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed, to driue <hi>Dauid</hi> to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire: but God directed him for exerciſe of <hi>Dauids</hi> patience: The diuell lied in the falſe Prophets, to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine <hi>Achab;</hi> but God iuſtly to puniſh him for his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to ſatisfie the deſire of his yong beardleſſe counſellors: but God to performe the word that hee had ſpoken by his Prophet. <hi>Pilate</hi> to pleaſe the people, and to keepe his credit with <hi>Caeſar: Iudas</hi> for the obtaining of the money he deſired; and the Iewes, that our Sauiour Chriſt ſhould not reigne ouer them; but God and Chriſt to ſaue his people.</p>

               <p>If he permit ſin, he doth it againſt, or with his wil: if he doe it againſt his will, then is he not Almightie, as one that cannot let that he would not haue done. If with his will, how can his iuſtice bee defended, if there were not ſome good thing, for which hee doth willingly permit it? for if a captaine ſhould ſuffer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly his ſouldiers to be murdered, when hee might hinder the ſlaughter of them, although hee put no hand to the murder, he is not therfore excuſable and free of the blood of his ſouldiers.</p>

               <p>That there ſhall be a generall Apoſtaſie, or falling away from the truth of the Goſpell before the latter day.</p>

               </p>
               <p>No: it were impoſſible that a perfit head ſhould be without a body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why is it then called generall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe the Goſpell hauing bin vniuerſallie prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched throughout the world, from it both whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did fall, and the moſt part alſo euen of thoſe nations that kept the profeſſion of it; howbeit, ſtill there remained a Church, although there were no ſetled eſtate thereof.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Why not? and that moſt iuſtly: for if the whole

               <p>
                  <hi>Is this Apoſtaſie neceſſarilie laid vpon the ſea of Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes verily, as by the deſcription that followeth may euidently appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the parts of this Apoſtaſie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The head, and the body: for as Chriſt is the head of the Church, which is his bodie; ſo the Pope is the head of the Romiſh Church, and it is his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is this Antichriſtian head deſcribed vnto vs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, hee is deſcribed what he is towards others: and then, what he is in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is he towards others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is declared by two ſpeciall titles, of <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>ſonne of perdition;</hi> declaring hereby, not ſo much his owne ſinne, and perdition, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great; as of thoſe that receiue his marke, whom he cauſeth to ſinne, and conſequently, to fall into another perdition; as <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who is often branded with the marke of cauſing Iſrael to ſin: and ſo much more deteſtable then he, as both his idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is more execrable, and as he drew more king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes after him then <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did Tribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In what ſenſe is he called the man of ſinne?</hi>

               <p>In cauſing manie to ſinne; iuſtifying ſinne, not by ouerſight, but by lawes aduiſedly made; not onely in a ſort commanding the ſinnes wee are by our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature prone vnto, as fornication ſpirituall and bodily; but alſo permitting and teaching for lawfull, ſuch as euen our corrupt nature (not wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted through enormous cuſtome of ſinne) abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as inceſtuous mariages, and breaking of faith, and leagues; which prophane men (by the light of nature) deteſt, to the great prophanation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name and profeſſion of Chriſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.</note>Not as the vnthrift mentioned in the Goſpell; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>Iudas,</hi> who is paſſiuely called the ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but actiuely, as it is otherwhere expounded, where he is called the deſtroyer, becauſe he deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many: whereunto ſome of his owne ſecretaries doe agree; confeſſing that many well diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, before their entrie into that ſee, became curſed and cruell beaſts in the ſame: as if there were ſome peſtilent poyſon in that place and ſeate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What learne you of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That euery office or calling which the Lord doth not bleſſe, or wherein none occupying, the place groweth in piety, is to bee eſteemed for an vnlawfull calling, wherein ſome at the leaſt in all ages are not found profitable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, or Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the vſe of all this doctrine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſeeing whoſoeuer are partakers of the ſinnes of Rome, are alſo vnder the ſame curſe, thoſe of vs which haue liued in Poperie, ſhould examine our ſelues if we haue truely repented vs of it: firſt, by the change of our vnderſtanding; as if wee haue growne
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19187:136"/> in the knowledge of the truth: And ſecondly, of our affections, if we hate Poperie, and loue the truth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly. And ſo let euery one iudge himſelfe, that wee bee not iudged, as wee muſt expect an harder iudgment, according to the long patience of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What further?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there can bee no ſound agreement betwixt Poperie, and the profeſſion of the Goſpell; no more then betwixt light and darkenes, falſhood and truth, God and Belial: and therefore no reconciliation can be deuiſed betwixt them: for if the members of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall bee deſtroyed, wee cannot in any ſort communicate with their errors, vnles we beare them companie in their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why? doth euery errour deſtroy the ſoule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No verily: for as euery wound killeth not the man;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> ſo euery errour depriueth not a man of ſaluation: but as the vitall parts being wounded or infected bring death; ſo thoſe errours that deſtroy the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points and heads of the truth, bring euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting deſtruction; in which kind is poperie, as that which ſundrilie ouerthroweth the principles and grounds of our holy faith; and therefore tearmed an apoſtaſie, or departure from the faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heere then may be asked, whether the Pope may bee ſaued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not impoſſible, his ſinne being not neceſſarily againſt the holy Ghoſt, to which onely repentance is denied: for ſome no doubt haue entred into that ſee ignorantly; and therefore find place to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the Antichrist, what he is towards others. What is he in himſelfe?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:19187:137"/>
               <p>That is ſet downe by two effects: Firſt, that hee is vicegerent vnto Chriſt; not by any right, but by vſurpation; and therefore alſo an aduerſarie, as alſo the word implieth both; ſo much more dangerous, as hee exerciſeth his enmitie vnder the colour and pretence of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherein is he aduerſarie vnto Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Euery way; in life, and in office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How in life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that Chriſt being moſt pure, holy, and holineſſe it ſelfe; the popes, although in truth moſt filthie, and abominable in blaſpheming, coniuring, murdering, whoring, and that inceſtuouſly, and Sodomitically, yet will they in titles bee called holy; yea as Chriſt, holines it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How in office?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in his kingdome: Chriſts kingdome is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all outward ſhew or pompe; but the Popes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome conſiſteth wholly in pompe and ſhewes, as imitating his predeceſſors, the emperors of Rome, in his proud, ſtately, and lordly offices, Princelie traines, and outragious expences in euery ſort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How elſe in his office?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In raiſing vp another ſacrifice then Chriſt; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prieſthood then his, other mediators then him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is there any thing elſe wherein hee taketh vpon him the office of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes: in that he teacheth cleane contrarie to him: Chriſt taught nothing but what hee receiued of his father: the Pope ſetteth out his owne canons and decrees of councels.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:19187:137"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the ſecond effect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he is exceedingly lift vp againſt all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God; which alſo proueth the former expoſition: for Chriſt being very God, abaſeth himſelfe vnto the nature of man: the Pope a vile man, aduanceth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the throne of God. Chriſt being aboue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power, paid tribute, and was taxed, euen in his mothers wombe; and ſuffered himſelfe to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a crowne of thornes, and bare his owne croſſe: But the Pope being vnder all ſecular power, exalteth himſelfe aboue all ſecular powers; exacteth tribute of Kings; ſetteth his foote on the necke of Emperours; carrieth a triple crowne of gold, and is borne vpon mens ſholders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is not the Pope humble, when he calleth himſelfe the ſeruant of ſeruants?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No: for by his owne Canoniſts hee doth it, but diſſemblingly with hypocriſie, which is double ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: for they ſay that hee doth in humility ſay ſo, not that he is ſo indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What other anſwere doe they make to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſeruice being limited and tied onely to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> he needeth not to feare leſt by this humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation he be put to much paines, ſeeing he hath wiſely made himſelfe ſeruant to thoſe that can aske him nothing, and to whom hee can performe nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the effects of this his pride?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are two: firſt, hee ſitteth in the Church as God, when as hee bindeth the conſciences of men by his decrees, which no Princes lawes, meerely ciuill, can do; for theſe, men are diſcharged of in the paiment of the penaltie preſcribed in them.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:19187:138"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this it ſeemeth that the Church of Rome is yet the Church of God, although corrupt, ſeeing it is ſaid that he ſitteth in the temple of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No verily: it beareth only the name of it; for the Scripture giueth the name to a thing according to that it hath beene: as when Chriſt ſaith the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhall ſtand in the holy place; he meaneth not that the temple was then holy, which at that time, being no figure nor ſhadow of Chriſt, and his Church, was prophaned, but that it had beene holy: ſo wee confeſſe there hath beene a true Church in Rome, which is now no Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is the other effect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He boaſteth that he is God, as the Popes flatterers in the Canon law cal him, Our Lord God the Pope. Neither is this his church-pride only, in challenging the name of God, but alſo he challengeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe things proper to God, as the title of holines: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to forgiue ſinnes, and to carrie infinit ſoules to hel, without check or controlement; and to make of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſomthing, and the ſcripture to be no ſcripture, and no ſcripture to be ſcripture at his pleaſure; yea, to make of a creature the Creator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may ſeeme to bee an impoſsible thing, that men ſhould be carried away from the faith of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, by one ſo monſtrous and directlie oppoſite to Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If at once and at a ſudden, he had ſhewed himſelfe in ſuch ſort of foule colours, it might haue bin doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and therefore by certaine degrees of iniquitie, he in the end came to this height of wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is that?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:19187:138"/>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſheweth of two courſes the diuell held to bring this to paſſe; one ſecret, and couert, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this man of ſinne was reuealed; the other, when he was reuealed, and ſet vp in his ſeate.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Thoſe ſeuerall errours which were ſpread partly in the Apoſtles time, and partly after their time, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make a way for his comming. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, this myſterie of iniquitie was begun to bee wrought, as it were, vnder the ground, and ſecretly in the Apoſtles time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How was this mysterie of iniquitie wrought in the Apoſtles time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By diuers errors ſowne by heretikes, as it were pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Antichriſts; in that ſome were deſirous to bee Lords ouer the Church, ſome held iuſtification by works, ſome held the worſhipping of Angels, ſome put religion in meates, and ſome had a ſpeciall liking of virginitie, and miſliking of mariage: all which were beginnings and grounds of Poperie and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What gather you of all theſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That thoſe whom God hath freed from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Poperie, ſhould ſtriue to free themſelues from all the remnants thereof; leſt if they cleaue ſtill to any one, God in iudgement bring the whole vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ſhall his kingdome be continued and aduanced after that he is reuealed?</hi>

                  <hi>What difference is there betwixt Chriſts miracles and theirs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very great euery way: for Chriſts miracles were true, whereas theſe are falſe and lying, as by legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that ſeeing the Popes Kingdome hangeth vpon wonders, it is moſt like that he is Antichriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſeeing the falſe chriſts, and the falſe prophets ſhall do great wonders, to deceiue, if it were poſſible, the very elect, and that though ſome of the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets prophecies ſhal come to paſſe; wee ſhould not therefore beleeue the doctrine of Poperie, for their wonders ſakes, ſeeing the Lord thereby trieth our faith, who hath giuen to Satan great knowledge and power to work ſtrange things, to bring thoſe to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, who are appointed vnto it. Whatſoeuer mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are not profitable to ſome good, neither tend to confirme a truth, are falſe and lying; ſo that as the Lord left an euident difference betweene his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.</note> and the Inchantments of the Egyptians; ſo hath he left an euident difference betweene the miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and thoſe of the Romiſh Synagogue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are not miracles as neceſſarie now, as they were in the time of the Apoſtles?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:19187:139"/>
               <p>No verily: for the doctrine of the Goſpell being then new vnto the world, had need to haue beene confirmed with miracles from heauen; but it being once confirmed, there is no more need of miracles; and therfore we keeping the ſame doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, muſt content our ſelues with the confirmation which hath already beene giuen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ariſeth out of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the doctrine of Poperie is a new doctrine, hauing need to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed with new miracles; and ſo it is not the doctrine of Chriſt, neither is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by his miracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What force ſhall the miracles of Antichrist haue?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Maruellous great, to bring many men to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; God in iuſt reuenge of the contempt of the truth, ſending a ſtrong deluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hitherto wee haue heard Antichriſt deſcribed by his effects and properties. Now tell mee where is the place where he ſhould haue his ſeate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is the Citie of Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How doth that appeare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe he that <hi>letted</hi> at the time when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, was Emperour; who did then ſit there, and muſt be diſſeated ere the Pope could enter vpon it. Secondly, <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth that Citie where hee muſt ſit, the Lady of the world; which only agreeth to Rome, being the mother Citie of the world. Thirdly, it was that Citie that was ſeated vpon ſeuen hils; which by all ancient records belongeth properly and onely to Rome. As for the occaſion of the Popes placing there, it came by the meanes of tranſlating of the ſeate of the Empire from Rome to Conſtantinople; from whence enſued alſo the parting of the Empire
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:19187:140"/> into two parts; by which diuiſion it being weakened, and after alſo ſundred in affection, as well as in place, was the eaſier to bee entred and inuaded by the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What do you further gather of that the Apoſtle ſaith, that</hi> he that letteth ſhall let?</p>
               <p>That the Antichriſt is not one particular man, as the Papiſts doe phanſie: for then by the like phraſe he that letteth muſt be one particular man; where it cannot bee that one man ſhould liue ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres; as from <hi>Pauls</hi> time, to the time of the tranſlation of the Empire from Rome; much leſſe vntill within two yeeres and a halfe of the latter day, as they imagine the time of Antichriſt. And therefore as by him <hi>that letteth,</hi> is vnderſtood a ſucceſſion of Emperors, not one man alone; ſo by Antichriſt the man of ſin, is vnderſtood, a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of men, and not one onely man. So in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> 7.3.17. the foure beaſts, and the foure Kings, doe not ſignifie foure particular men, but foure go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments; in euery one whereof there were ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie men that ruled. So that of the Papiſts, who vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words, <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> would proue, that the Antichriſt the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, is one ſinguler man, is but vaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how can Antichriſt bee already come, ſeeing the Empire yet ſtandeth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The name of the Empire onely remaineth, the thing is gone: for hee hath neither the chiefe Citie, nor the tribute, nor the commandement of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and therefore he can be no let to the Antichriſts comming, eſpecially the Pope hauing gotten ſuch an vpper hand vpon him, as to cauſe him to waite
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:19187:140"/> at his gate barefoot, and to hold his ſtirrop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall be the end of this Antichriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God ſhall confound him with the breath of his mouth; that is, with the preaching of the word; which proueth the Pope to be Antichriſt: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had ſubdued Kingdomes and Empires vnder his feet, hee hath beene mightily ſuppreſſed by the word preached, and not by outward force, as other potentates are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What learne you of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The maruellous power of Gods word to ſuppreſſe whatſoeuer riſeth againſt it: for if the mightieſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand before it, much leſſe the ſmalleſt: and therefore it is expreſſed by a mighty wind, which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth all before it; and by fire, which conſumeth all, and pierceth all. And it declareth a maruellous eaſie victorie againſt the enemies, when it is ſaid, that with the breath of his mouth hee ſhall conſume his enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat elſe ſhall be the ouerthrow of Antichrist?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The glorious appearance of the ſon of God in the latter day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat gather you of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That before the laſt day hee ſhall not bee vtterly conſumed; whereof notwithſtanding it followeth not that the head ſhall remaine till then: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſome ſhall haue a liking of him, euen till the laſt day: for the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet ſhall bee taken, and caſt into the fire before the latter day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hitherto of the head of this generall apostaſie. VVhat are the members of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are firſt deſcribed by their end, euen a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of periſhing people; which accordeth to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

               <p>
                  <hi>What is the vſe of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That as no poyſon can take away the life of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: ſo, ſmall occaſions carie away ſuch as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it a proofe of reprobation to bee caried away with an errour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no certaine proofe, but a ſigne, eſpecially if the meanes of tranſporting be weake and ſmall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How otherwiſe are theſe rotten members of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ deſcribed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By that they neuer loued the truth, although they vnderſtood it, and profeſſed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ſhould a man loue the truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the truthes ſake; not for vaine glory, fleſhly delight or commoditie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How appeareth it that men loue the word of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they walke accordingly, and keepe faith in a good conſcience; which ſome loſing by their wicked life, loſt alſo their faith; that is, their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is it to be vnderſtood, that God giueth men vp to ſtrong deluſions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe God is a iuſt Iudge, which by them either puniſheth or correcteth former ſinnes, and eſpecially the contempt of the Goſpell; in which regard, euen amongſt vs now, ſome are caſt into the ſincke of Poperie; ſome into the familie of loue; ſome become Arians; ſome Anabaptiſts: all which are as it were diuers gaoles and dungeons: wherinto he throweth thoſe that are cold and careleſſe profeſſors of the Goſpell.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:19187:141"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>What learne you by this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they which imagine God fauourable vnto them notwithſtanding their ſinnes, becauſe their life, or goods, or honours are ſpared, are foulely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: rather, when the Lord ceaſeth to reproue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or to ſtriue with them; then doth hee giue them vp into vanitie of their owne minds, to doe their owne wicked wils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is our duetie in ſuch caſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To pray vnto the Lord: to keepe vs from all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: but if for our triall, or further hardening of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it pleaſe him to ſend errours amongſt vs, that it would pleaſe him to preſerue vs in that danger, that we taſte not of that baite, whereby Satan ſeeketh to angle vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What other cauſe is there of ſending theſe errours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That thoſe may bee damned, which beleeue not the truth: for as God hath appointed them to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; ſo betwixt his counſell in reiecting them, and the finall effect of it, there muſt bee ſin to bring that effect iuſtly vpon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat reaſon is annexed of their iuſt damnation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe they reſt in vnrighteouſnes, hauing their eares itching for errour, which they drinke in, as the earth drinketh vp raine, or the fiſhes water. So that albeit they bee powerfully ſent of God in his iuſt iudgement, yet are they alſo greedily deſired and affected of them.</p>

               <p>They are ſuch as ſhall come within an age of the ſecond comming of Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>VVhat is the firſt of them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders.</p>

                  <hi>VVhat is the errour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it ſhall be ſaid, heere is Chriſt, or there: for there ſhall be falſe Chriſts, which ſhall pretend the very perſon of Chriſt; not Antichriſt, who tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himſelfe the vicar of Chriſt. Theſe alſo ſhall haue their miniſters; namely, falſe prophets, which ſhall get credit vnto the falſe Chriſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What learne you by this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Church of God is put vnder triall: firſt, of their knowledge and vnderſtanding, whether they can diſcerne betweene errour, and truth: ſecondly, of their loue and fidelitie; that after they know the truth, they will ſticke by it.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>The danger of it, in that it maketh ſhew of the corporall preſence of Chriſt, whereunto wee are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally greatly giuen; as appeareth, not only by the Papiſts, but by the holy Apoſtles themſelues, which were too much addicted to the corporal preſence of Chriſt: ſecondly, alſo by the great meanes they ſhall haue of the wonderfull miracles they ſhall doe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the true Miniſters of God ſhall not haue

               <p>
                  <hi>What further doe you learne of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The extreame impudencie of the diuell in the wicked in thoſe daies, which hath neuer beene heard of before, that a ſinfull mortall man ſhould take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be the ſon of the moſt High: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there were many that took vpon them to be the Meſſias, before and after the firſt comming of our Sauiour Chriſt; yet they imagining the Meſſias to be a bare man, were neuer ſo impudently arrogant, as to challenge to themſelues to bee the very ſonne of God.</p>

                  <hi>VVhat note you of this, that</hi> if it were poſſible the very elect ſhould be deceiued?</p>
               <p>Not onely the certainety of their happie eſtate, from whence they cannot fall, but that the ſame cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety hath a foundation, not in any thing that is in men; but in the purpoſe and counſell of God, which cannot be deceiued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the error. What is the remedy againſt it?</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, not to go out, that is, ſo certainly to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the vntruth of the thing, notwithſtanding the greatneſſe of the miracles, as not once to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: for thoſe that haue itching eares, and wanton rolling eyes, to heare and ſee things, are often times by Gods iuſt iudgement deceiued, although they haue a purpoſe to the contrary. Secondly, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, although they ſhould heare or ſee thoſe things that are done, by ſome particular calling of their place, conſtraining them to bee preſent at the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19187:143"/> place where thoſe are, or otherwiſe to bee brought forciblie vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the confutation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that it cannot bee Chriſt, that they ſhould goe out into the wilderneſſe to ſee; becauſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with great brightneſſe, as the lightning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the Eaſt, and ſhineth vnto the Weſt; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall one need to go vnto the wilderneſſe to ſee him: firſt, becauſe his light ſhall bee ſeene in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world alike: ſecondly, alſo hee will not come on the earth, but into the aire onely.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That hee ſhall come ſuddenly, as in a moment; whereas before hee had ſpace, to goe from place to place. Neither auailes it then to go out after &amp; ſeeke him; becauſe as ſpeedilie as the Eagles are gathered to the dead carcaſe; ſo the children of God, being compared vnto Eagles, ſhall ſuddenly be gathered to our Sauiour Chriſt; who is compared to a carcaſe in reſpect of his death.</p>

               <p>Yes verily, hee is able to doe it without any ſuch inſtrument; as he is alſo able to ſaue men extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, without the preaching of his word; yet hee will vſe this outward meanes of a ſound, as of a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in gathering of his ſaints; as he vſeth his word an ordinarie meanes to call them.</p>

                  <hi>Is not this power of Chriſt exerciſed in vs whileſt we are aliue?</hi>

               <p>Yes very effectually, in quickening vs by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to his obedience, who are by nature dead in ſin; and ſo not onely vnable, but alſo vnwilling to any good: wherefore, God ioyneth power to his word, to raiſe from death to life, as well ſpiritually in the firſt, as corporally in the ſecond reſurrection; and that this firſt reſurrection is a manifeſt pledge of the ſecond, there being greater difficultie in the former then in the latter reſurrection for as in the latter there is no will to riſe, ſo there is no till or gaine ſaying, which in the former is great.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That ſeeing our bed is fitly compared vnto the graue, and our ſleepe vnto death, wee conſider how wee lay our ſelues downe into our beds, being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that if we haue faith as a fetherbed under vs, and good workes as a couerlet ouer vs; then no doubt as a wearie man in the morning is refreſhed; ſo ſhall we after the troubles of this life, riſe againe in ioy and conſolation: and as if the ſunne ſet faire, it is a token
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19187:145"/> that it will ſo riſe: ſo when the ſunne of our ſoules ſets well, it is a token of a ioyfull riſing of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is meant by this, that</hi> one generation ſhall not paſſe?</p>
               <p>That as it was ſaid before, that one generation ſhould not paſſe vntill the deſtruction of Ieruſalem were accompliſhed, which indeed came about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres after: ſo verily all theſe ſignes of the falſe Chriſts, and the darkening of the lights of heauen (as hath beene ſpoken) ſhall come within an age of the latter day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore is this vehement aſſeueration vſed,</hi> that heauen and earth ſhall paſſe, but not one iot of the word ſhall paſſe?</p>
               <p>Againſt thoſe mockers, which ſhall come in the latter time, and charge the Miniſterie of the Goſpell with vntruth; becauſe they ſee no alteration in the courſe of nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But all this while heere is no mention made of the ſaying of</hi> Elias, <hi>touching the time of the laſt day; which is, that there ſhall bee two thouſand yeeres before the law, two thouſand vnder the Law, and two thouſand after the Law; and then that theſe daies ſhall be ſhortened for the elects ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no cauſe why, conſidering it is without authority of the word, as that which is not in the Scripture, and of <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet; but of another <hi>Elias,</hi> neither Prophet, nor ſon of a Prophet. Beſide that, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vntruth therof doth manifeſtly appeare; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that both before the Law, there were more then two thouſand; and vnder the Law there were leſſe then two thouſand, by ſundrie hundred yeers. And where it is ſaid, that for the elects ſake thoſe
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19187:145"/> daies ſhall be ſhortened; it is ſpoken of the ſlaughter daies of the Iewes by the Romane, in the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, and not of the latter day. For it is rather true, that the end of the world is deferred for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; for that there ſhall be an end thereof, aſſoone as the number of the elect be come into the world and fulfilled;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> and for that the day of the Lord ſhall not come, vntill all the prophecies in the booke of the Apocalyps be fulfilled: Laſt of all, that the iniquitie of the wicked be come to a full meaſure, which the Lord obſeruing in other iudgements, will in that moſt fearefull iudgement much more obſerue. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, this opinion is ſtrengthened, in that the world ſhall bee gouerned ſix thouſand, in a proportion of one thouſand yeers to euery of the ſix daies wherein it was created: the proofe whereof is drawne from Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> who ſaith, that with God a thouſand yeeres are as a day. This reaſon interfeereth with the other; for the other ſaith, that there ſhall bee cut off from the laſt two thouſand; where this preſuppoſeth a full accompliſhment of them; otherwiſe it cannot be proportionable to the daies of the creation, which was not accompliſhed but in the full number of ſix daies; the ſame ſpace and time being taken in the creation of the laſt day, which was vſed in any of the reſt. And as for the place of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> it is not ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly reſtrained to one thouſand yeeres, but that it may be retched out further: for vnto God two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers is not ſo long as one day are vnto vs; which is the compariſon which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They alledge further, that there ſhall be ſuch coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and diſpoſition of the ſtarres at the end of that time, as muſt needs make an and of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:19187:146"/>
               <p>But this doctrine of the time of the worlds end, is a part of the Goſpell; and therefore hidden ſo in God, as if hee had not reuealed it by his ſonne, could not haue been knowne. And if the end of the world could bee knowne from the courſe of the planets, and ſtarres; then our Sauiour Chriſt, being as hee is a man, the cunningeſt Aſtronomer that euer was, ſhould as a man haue knowne it. The follie and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this opinion alſo may partly be ſeene by thoſe which haue waited for this deſtruction of the world, by concourſe of the heauenly bodies, in the yeere 1588.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is not the day and hoare of the comming of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No verily; his comming within an age may bee knowne vnto man; but the day and the houre no man knoweth, no not the Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What gather you of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there appeareth no euill will of God towards vs in concealing the day of his comming, foraſmuch as the Angels, who are ſaid to be full of eyes in regard of their ſingular wiſedome, know it not: yea and that which is more, Chriſt himſelfe who is greatly wiſer then Angels, is ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how can that bee, that he which gouerneth all things, ſhould be ignorant of that day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is, that in that regard he is both God and man, he knoweth it; but not as he is the ſon of man, eſpecially vnglorified, that is to ſay, before his aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the reaſons that God reſerueth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the hoare of his comming to himſelfe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are two; one in regard of himſelfe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19187:146"/> in regard of vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the reaſon in regard of himſelfe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That as it is the honour of a King, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, know ſomething that his counſell and all other are ignorant of; ſo, and much more it is an honour vnto God, to conceale from other, both men and Angels, ſome ſecrecie which he onely knoweth.</p>

                  <hi>What learne you of this?</hi>

                  <hi>What is the cauſe that men ſeeke to know the ſecrets of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe they know not thoſe things that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto them which if they did, they would reſiſt without curious ſearch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the reaſon of concealing the day and houre of the latter day, in regard of our ſelues?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that by this concealement, we are made more watchfull: for although the time of the Blood was knowne to the old world; yet it came to paſſe, that it ouertooke them vnawares: and Prou. 6.7, the harlot is the boldes to commit wickedneſſe, becauſe the day of her husbands returne was ſet and appointed by him.</p>

                  <hi>What learne of you this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That beſides the dangerous rocks of the falſe chriſts, and their prophets, which ſhall carrie away many, there ſhall be yet more dangerous rockes and ſands; namely, that in the laſt times, men ſhall be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, marrying, and giuen to mariage.</p>

                  <hi>What gather you of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That thereby the Lord doth take a triall of the conſciences of his children, whether they will be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the inticements of theſe pleaſures, as before he tooke triall of their knowledge by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer errours: and withall by the ſame meanes, hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth of the meanes, whereby the wicked may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly periſh, in that thoſe whom one miſchiefe doth not entangle, another may reach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why, ſhall thoſe things bee imputed as ſinnes vnto men, ſeeing they are both lawfull and neceſſarie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is, that eating and drinking, and giuing to marriage, buying and ſelling, planting and building, are in their owne nature lawfull and neceſſarie; but our Sauiour Chriſt chargeth them with the abuſe of theſe things; thereby to declare, that a great condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is due vnto thoſe things, which before men are not condemned.

               <p>By the bridegrome, is ſignified our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, whoſe ſpouſe is the Church; and by the ten Virgins, are meant the profeſſours of the Goſpel, profeſſing their attendance to the Church their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Chriſt their redeemer.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That it is not ſufficient to haue only the bare ſigns of Chriſtianity, and ſome taſte of the good word of God, and of the power of the world to come: but we muſt examine our ſelues, whether wee haue that oyle of the grace of God, whereby true Chriſtians may bee diſcerned from hypocrites; as theſe wiſe Virgins from the fooliſh.</p>

               <p>Not that they had no light of Gods graces in them at all; but that all the light they had, was of that kind that dieth with them, not being in the number of the graces of true ſanctification, and repentance: ſo that when they were to bee changed, or raiſed in the latter day, they haue no good grace at all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might with boldneſſe appeare before the Iudge of all the world.</p>

                  <hi>May it not bee gathered from hence, that there are no workes of ſupererogation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is indeed vſed for that purpoſe of good men: But beſide that, in matter of controuerſie it is not meete to ſtretch parables beyond their ſcope; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of the workes of ſupererogation would build another dangerous errour, that men ſhould haue workes enow to ſaue themſelues.</p>

                  <hi>What is the meaning of the parable?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Did not Christ beſtow his graces vpon his Church before his aſcenſion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No doubt; but in regard of the exceeding great graces which hee beſtowed after his aſcending, his former gifts were accounted but as nothing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the elect they were ſufficient to ſaluation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If they grudge not at the meaſure of others, much leſſe ſhould wee grudge at the greater graces of God in other men: and if they reſted in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters wiſedome and iudgement, who might faile, much more ſhould wee reſt in the iudgement of our God, who cannot faile; nay rather, we are aſſured, that whatſoeuer he beſtoweth vpon any one, is for the good of all: for euery one hath his portion in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens gifts.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Not ſo: for although ſome naturall men excell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in wit and iudgement, whereby they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the diſcharge of their temporall affaires;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.13.</note> yet it is not ſo in the ſpirituall, ſeeing the beginning, proceeding, and perfection thereof is the free gift of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much in the diſtribution of talents. What conſider you in the occupying of them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That if men labour earneſtly for gaine in vſing worldly money; much more ſhould we in the vſe of the ſpirituall; eſpecially ſeeing the beſt aduenturers may bee croſſed in the gaine of their merchandiſe: but the gaine of this ſpirituall merchandiſe is moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, when it is employed according to the mind of the giuer.</p>

                  <hi>How did they occupie their talents?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that receiued fiue, gained fiue more; and hee that receiued two, gained likewiſe two more.</p>

                  <hi>VVhat gather you from thence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That no man ſhould meaſure himſelfe by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans foot, as if it were enough to doe as others doe: but as God hath meaſured out his graces to vs, ſo ſhould we practiſe; neither ought he that receiues but two talents, to take an occaſion to doe nothing, becauſe he cannot do ſo much as others which haue receiued fiue; but to labour faithfully, according to the gifts which God hath beſtowed vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What further ariſeth out of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That a Chriſtian man ought to know the meaſure
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19187:152"/> of his gifts (ſo that he be neither proud nor ouerwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby) the better to know his account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Did all that receiued talents gaine accordingly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No: for the third receiuing but one talent, hid it in the ground vntill his maſters returne, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied it not at all; which ſetteth out the ſluggiſhneſſe of the vnfaithfull ſeruants.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Is this iudgement proper onely to the ſluggard?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No; it agreeth aſwell to all thoſe that ſeeke their owne gaine, and not their Lords, how earneſt ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they ſeeme to bee in the vſe of their gifts, eating the bread of carefulneſſe, and drinking the water of affliction: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hitherto of the talents and the vſe of them. What conſider you in the accounts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that the day of account ſhall come, although the time (indeed ſhort) ſeeme long in our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore wee muſt continue without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the earneſt practiſe of godlines: for if the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety of the maſters comming maketh the ſeruant watchfull, who notwithſtanding may die before his maſter come home, and his maſter alſo die before the taking of accounts; much more ſhould we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our watch, who are vndoubtedly aſſured of the comming of Chriſt, and of our appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Secondly, the accounts muſt bee faithfull; for if the maſter may bee deceiued in his accounts; yet our maſter Chriſt cannot bee deceiued: and if
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:19187:153"/> good ſeruants haue beene found faithfull without rendring accounts; let vs much more be faithfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured of our accounts which we ſhall giue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What was the reward of the faithfull ſeruants?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two fold; one in honour, another in ioy: the honour was firſt in the word of commendation of a faithfull ſeruant, which is an excellent thing, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially comming from God: and ſecondly, in the ſingular rule and preferment ouer others according to their place, which is ſet forth in their fellowſhip with their maſter, both at table and in iudgement; yet not of deſert, but of the free grace, as the former gifts were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the reward in ioy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In partaking their maſters ioy, which is vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in God; for none knoweth it, but hee that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth it; and therefore neither Angels nor men can conceiue it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the reward of the faithfull ſeruants. What is it of the vnfaithfull?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not only in depriuing them of thoſe good things before mentioned; but alſo by the flat contrarie, a caſting of them into perpetuall diſhonour, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnſpeakeable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the parable of the talents. VVhat is the meaning of the other parable of ſheepe and goates?</hi>

               <p>That ſuddenly breaking out of the heauens, his glory ſhall be of ſuch ſingular brightneſſe, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching vnto the ſunne, it ſhall bee darkened, and the moone ſhall loſe her light: for if when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt was transfigured vpon the Mount <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> being then mortall, his face did ſhine as the ſun; then much more at his ſecond comming his Maieſty ſhall be wonderfull, ſeeing it is now both immortall and glorified: and ſeeing hee appeared ſo glorious, when his face onely was ſeene; how much more when he ſhall appeare naked, and bee ſeene in all his bleſſed body, as the onely <hi>Abſolon</hi> of God, perfect in all beautie, and comelineſſe vnſpeakeable?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ſhall the glory of his comming appeare in the things belonging vnto him, at his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt of all in his angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ſhall his glory appeare in them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In their number, and in their excellencie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How in their number?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that they are infinite thouſands; which before hauing bin ſeuered in their diuers ſeruices they haue been employed in, ſhall then all together and ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend vpon Chriſt, and the ſeruice of that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How in their excellencie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that they alſo ſhall bee of great glory, by the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:19187:154"/> glory they haue of him: for if an angell appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring be like vnto lightning; then much more there muſt be great glory and brightneſſe in the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companie of Angels that ſhall attend vpon our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is further belonging to the glory of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His glorious throne, whereupon he ſhall actually and really ſit, ſhadowed out by the glorious throne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> which was of pure gold; whereof how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the matter bee vnknowne vnto vs, yet wee know it ſhall be ſutable to the excellencie of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the proper vſe heereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To bee armed againſt all ſhame and feare in the profeſſion of Chriſt and his truth; before whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer earthly Monarches, whoſe iudgements are as it were ſcar-crowes to the iudgement of Chriſt; to whom that properly belongeth, which <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> fooliſhly bragged of his maſter, concerning the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the leaſt of his ſeruants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the effects of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are partly in the wicked, and partly in the godly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat worketh it in the wicked?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mourning and lamentation, for feare and terror of the power and Maieſtie of Chriſt, and his Angels, comming in the clouds; which ſhall be a peece of hel vnto them, before they ſhall feele it: euen as guiltie priſoners will be terrified at the ſight of the Iudges, and Iuſtices, before any execution of iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What gather you of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, if at the bare ſight of theſe ſignes the wicked
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:19187:154"/> ſhall be ſo terrified; how much more when they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued the ſentence of damnation, the ſame ſhall bee executed? Againe, if the godly hauing their ſinnes forgiuen them, are afraid at the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of one Angell; much more the wicked, which haue their ſinnes tied faſt vpon them, will bee afraid at the ſight of ſo many Angels. And if a ſparke of godlines, without any appearance of glory, in a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, be terrible to the wicked; much more the maieſty of the ſon of God, altogether holy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, will ſtrike an infinite feare into them; and make them deſire that the rockes and mountaines falling vpon them might hide them from his ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat are the effects of Christs comming in the godly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſhall reioyce and bee glad at this glorious comming, which they looked and prayed for; euen as a faithfull ſeruant is glad when his maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with much honour and good ſpeed in all his affaires, the honour and glory of his maſter ſeruing to his further aduancement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is there yet nothing belonging to the glory of his comming?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes; that the heauens, and the earth, and all the creatures of God, ſhall be put in a new liuerie againſt the comming of Chriſt; and therfore that we ſhould much more cleanſe our ſelues, thereby to bee fit to inhabit ſuch changed and cleanſed places as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How doth our Sauiour Chriſt garniſh and enlarge this doctrine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By a parable of the figge tree, which elegantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the certainety and comfort of the former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:19187:155"/> that when the figge tree bringeth forth her leaues, we know the ſummer is neere: ſo when wee ſee the ſignes aforeſaid come to paſſe, the day of the Lord is euen at the dores, and the ſummer of the Church of God is at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What learne you of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That as the ſummer is the moſt pleaſant ſeaſon, and moſt of all others to bee deſired: ſo wee ſhould long after the comming of Chriſt, when we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a perpetuall ſummer, without all manner of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtormes, or troubles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hitherto of the preparation of the glory of Christ. How ſhall they be ranged?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is ſet forth by a parable of the ſhepheard, and the ſheepe: for as the ſhepheard when the euening commeth gathereth his flocke, and ſeparateth the ſheepe from the goates: ſo in the euening of the world, our Sauiour Chriſt ſhall gather all nations by the miniſterie of the Angels; and then there ſhall be a full ſeparation; the godly being ſet on his right hand, and the wicked on the left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat learne you of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference between the iudgements of God, and the iudgements of men, where both the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and guiltie are confuſedly preſented at one bar: but then there ſhall be two barres through a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the wicked and the godly; which ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Angels moſt eaſily make, in diſcerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, as otherwiſe, ſo by their cheerefull or fearefull countenances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhy are the godly compared vnto ſheepe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in regard of their ſimplicitie; which yet hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth them not to know the voice of their ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard:
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:19187:155"/> ſecondly, in regard of the profit which they bring, both when they are liuing and ſlaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhy are the vngodly compared vnto goates?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe they are like them in ſtraying, climbing, and the ſtinch they caſt forth, in their vnſpeakeable vnſauorie conuerſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hitherto of the preparation. What is the iudgement?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is as it were a great aſſiſe, wherein euery one muſt appeare perſonally, before the great Iudge, and receiue vnto himſelfe the ſentence of ſaluation, or condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat are the parts of this iudgement?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two: firſt, the ſentence of the Iudge; which is twofold; one for the faithfull, another againſt the the wicked: and ſecondly, the execution of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the former ſentence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſpoken to the godly; <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit the kingdone prepared for you before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why doth the iudgement begin at the godly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſeeing they muſt ſit with Chriſt to iudge the world, they might bee fitted vnto it, by clearing before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What gather you of this order?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A notable comfort to the godly againſt all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that as the Lord in mercie beginneth his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at them in this life: ſo in the latter day hee ſhall beginne with them the iudgement of ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and that hauing beene miſiudged heere, they ſhal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudge their Iudges, vnles in time they repent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What learne you out of this former ſentence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, a notable harmonie, betwixt Chriſt and his
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:19187:156"/> Church; that as they ſay vnto him, <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come quickly:</hi> ſo ſhall he ſay vnto them; <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father, come;</hi> declaring their exceeding deſire of mutuall fellowſhip, and ſocietie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What elſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That life euerlaſting is called a kingdome; and therefore euery godly one ſhall bee a king in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How commeth this kingdome? by grace, or deſert?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the onely grace of God in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Declare the ſame more euidently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it is the bleſſing of God; and therefore of grace. Secondly, it is giuen to vs as to heires, not as the wages of a ſeruant, which commonly deſerueth more then a ſonne. Thirdly, it was prepared for vs from the beginning of the world; and therefore is of the meere loue of God, and not of merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the ſentence. What is the reaſon of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Chriſt was an hungred they fedde him; when hee was a thirſt, they gaue him drinke; when he was naked, they clothed him; when he was ſicke, and in priſon, they viſited him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doth not this reaſon plainely ſtrengthen the doctrine of merits?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">For.</note>Not ſo, ſeeing <hi>(for)</hi> importeth not heere the cauſe, but the effect: as wee ſay, Summer is come, for flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers doe ſpring; and, It is a good tree, for it bringeth forth good fruit; theſe are effects and not cauſes. Moreouer, if Chriſt would haue taught merit, then would hee haue choſen the greateſt and chiefeſt workes; as of his owne worſhip in the firſt table: elſe ſome might iuſtly complaine that they were not rewarded, according to the meaſure of their good
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:19187:156"/> workes, hauing yeelded a greater obedience to the firſt table then others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why then doth Chriſt chooſe thoſe workes of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe they are moſt manifeſt to the world; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing therein the cuſtome of earthly Iudges, who inſiſt moſt vpon plaineſt proofes, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the guiltie, or cleere the innocent: ſo Chriſt pronounceth his ſentence rather according to workes, then to faith, and thoſe of the ſecond table, rather then of the firſt; becauſe that workes are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and faith inuiſible; and for that it is eaſier to play the hypocrite in the obedience of the firſt table, then of the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why doth Chriſt heere vſe ſo long a catalogue of theſe workes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To teach vs to exerciſe mercy in all thoſe duties, and not content our ſelues with any one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How could they doe theſe things vnto Chriſt, whom moſt of them did neuer ſee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they did any of them to the poore, then they did it vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What gather you of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it was a great honour to lodge Angels at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares in ſtead of ſtrangers: but this is a farre more excellent honour whereunto Chriſtians are called; being aſſured that in receiuing the poore, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Chriſt himſelfe; which ſhould ſtirre vp the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of mercy and compaſſion in vs towards them; ſeeing not ſo much as a cup of cold water ſhall bee vnrewarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how is it that they being then immortall, ſeeme not to know the meaning of this dutie?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:19187:157"/>
               <p>It is ſet downe, not to note ignorance; but to teach vs the exceeding bountifulneſſe of Chriſt, which is able to aſtoniſh them in the middeſt of their greateſt knowledge: for the more men know of God, the more they wonder at the vnſearchable wiſedome of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the former ſentence. What is the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſpoken to the wicked. <hi>Depart from mee yee cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into euerlaſting fire, prepared for the diuell and his Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat is the equitie of this ſpeech?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is likewiſe anſwerable to their owne deſires, that in their life thruſt away from them the day of the Lord, and bid Chriſt depart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When doe the wicked ſay ſo to Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they refuſe to know his will; when they diſdaine the miniſterie, the poore, and the ſtranger; or doe not prouide for them according to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the parts of this his iudgement?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, to bee depriued of Gods preſence, as it is a great part of glory to be continually in his preſence. Secondly, to be euerlaſtingly tormented in hell fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the reaſon of this ſentence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is cleane contrarie to the former, in leauing thoſe duties vndone. And although the former good workes were not the cauſes of ſaluation; yet theſe euill workes are the very next cauſe of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How can that bee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe the beſt workes of the godly are imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly good, and cannot deſerue life: but the euill
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:19187:157"/> workes of the euill, are perfectly euill; and therefore deſerue death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be conſidered in their anſwere?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their exceeding wretchedneſſe whiles they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued heere, that neuer conſidered whom they reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in reiecting the poore.</p>

               <p>Contrarie to the order of the ſentences, it ſhall beginne at the wicked; for to the end the Angell that ſhall preſently take, binde, and caſt them into hell, may attend our Sauiour Chriſt returning, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect triumphantly going into heauen, the ſentence muſt be firſt executed vpon the wicked.

               <p>There ſeemeth indeed to bee ſome aduantage gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Iewes, who of the firſt Pſalme gather, that there is no reſurrection of the wicked: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is manifeſtly confuted, euen by this place it ſelfe, where it is ſaid, that <hi>many ſhall awake to ſhame euerlaſting.</hi> And when he ſaith <hi>(many)</hi> the word is not reſtrained to either the iuſt or wicked; but as many of the good ſhould awake, and not all; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the wicked ſhould awake, and not all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How then is this to be taken?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is taken ſeuerally by it ſelfe, as one whole which is diuided into his parts: As if he ſhould ſay, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number ſhall awake; an infinite or a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of iuſt; and an infinite or great number of the wicked. And the like forme of ſpeech to this is vſed of the Apoſtle, Rom. 5. verſ. 15.19. he ſaith that <hi>many are dead by the ſinne</hi> of <hi>Adam;</hi> and yet in the 18. verſ. he ſheweth, that by thoſe many, hee meaneth all; and ſo ſpeaketh that all were condemned in <hi>Adam:</hi> Likewiſe in the 18. verſ. it is ſaid, that the benefit of Chriſts death commeth to all; meaning the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that by faith are one with Chriſt, as we were all naturally with <hi>Adam;</hi> yet in the 15. and 19. verſes, thoſe that he called all, he tearmeth many. Although if he ſpeake of the wicked by themſelues, and of the godly by themſelues, it may bee truely ſaid, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the wicked, nor all the godly ſhall awake out of the duſt; becauſe ſome of both ſorts ſhall not die, but be changed onely.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note>

               <p>Two things: the firſt of the happineſſe which is common to all the good, in the ſecond verſe; and the other of the ſpeciall happineſſe that ſome ſhall haue aboue their fellowes, in the third.</p>

               </p>
               <p>From our communication and participation with God in Chriſt, which is ſet forth Apocal. 21.3. by that God will dwell with vs, and we with him: and Apocal. 3.20. Luk. 22.20. by ſimilitude of eating and drinking with him; and eating of the tree of life, and of the hidden manna: Apocal. 2.17. glorious clothes, Apoc. 3.5. of rule and dominion, Apoc. 2.26.27.28.</p>

                  <hi>How is the firſt ſet forth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee ſhall wipe away all teares, there ſhall bee no more death; no ſickneſſe, no ſorrow, no crying, no labour, no darkeneſſe: Apocal. 22.5. no not ſo much as the danger or perill, or feare of any euill, Apocal. 21.25. the gates ſhall not bee ſhut; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their minds and ſoules, they ſhall bee free from all thoſe good affections that haue any paine ioyned with them; as wrath, mercy, pitie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, feare, care, repentance, and ſuch like.</p>

               <p>And ſpecially, in beholding the glory of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, from whom alſo commeth all the good of the Saints and Angels we ſhall delight in, Iohn 17.24. Apoc. 22.4. 1. Iohn. 3.2. And they ſhall ſee his

                  <hi>Hitherto of the felicitie common to all. What is that which is ſpeciall?</hi>

               <p>It is deſcribed in the third verſe, where hee ſaith, that thoſe that haue taught many, and iuſtified ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; or as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, ſaued many, 1.

               </p>
               <p>No: for as heere it is ſaid that the Miniſters ſhall excell others: ſo 1. Cor. 4. it is declared that one Teacher ſhall haue greater glorie then another: as hee that planteth and layeth the ground worke, more then he that watereth and buildeth vpon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But amongst thoſe that are no Miniſters, ſhall not there be difference of glory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes: as the Martyrs ſhall bee preferred before the reſt, Apocal. 3.12. for euery one ſhall not bee a pillar in the Church: and as euery one hath gone beyond others in right vſe of the gifts beſtowed vpon him; ſo he ſhall receiue his reward, more or leſſe.</p>

               <p>None at all: for all ſhall bee full, although one haue more then another: as a veſſell containing a gallon, is as full for the bigneſſe, as that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ten; and the foot may for the proportion of a foot, be as beautifull as the hand, although it haue not ſo much beautie in it as the hand, which would be no grace in the body.</p>

               <p>Not ſo: for albeit they receiue according to their workes, yet they receiue it not for their workes.
